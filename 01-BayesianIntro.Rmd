## Bayesian data analysis

- Contrast with frequentist view
    - Probability is just limiting frequency
    - Uncertainty arises from sampling variation

- Bayesian probability much more general
    - Probability is in the small world
    - Coins are not random, but our ignorance makes them so

## Small and Large Worlds

- **Small world**: the world under the model's assumptions. Bayesian models are optimal, in the small world
- **Larger world**: the real world. No guarantee of optimality for any kind of model
- Have to worry about both

## Garden of Forking Data

- The future:
    - Full of branching paths
    - Each choice closes some

- The data:
    - Many possible events
    - Each observation eliminates some
