## Outside view

> _Likelihood function: In statistics, a likelihood function is a function of parameters of a statistical model given data. Likelihood functions play a key role in statistical inference, especially methods of estimating a parameter from a set of statistics. In informal contexts, "likelihood" is often used as a synonym for "probability". In statistics, a distinction is made depending on the roles of outcomes vs. parameters. Probability is used before data are available to describe possible future outcomes given a fixed value for the parameter. Likelihood is used after data are available to describe a function of a parameter for given outcome. [Wikipedia]_

## Outside view

- Data have distributions
- Parameters do not
- Distinguish _parameters_ and _statistics_
- Likelihood is not a probability distribution
- Imaginary _population_
- Bayes is sampling theory + priors
- Priors are uniquely subjective

## Bayesian data analysis

- Contrast with frequentist view
    - Probability is just limiting frequency
    - Uncertainty arises from sampling variation

- Bayesian probability much more general
    - Probability is in the small world
    - Coins are not random, but our ignorance makes them so

## Small and Large Worlds

<img style="float: right;" src="images/columbo.png" height="350">

- **Small world**: the world under the model's assumptions. Bayesian models are optimal, in the small world
- **Larger world**: the real world. No guarantee of optimality for any kind of model
- Have to worry about both

## Garden of Forking Data

- The future:
    - Full of branching paths
    - Each choice closes some

- The data:
    - Many possible events
    - Each observation eliminates some
